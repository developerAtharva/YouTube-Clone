# YouTube-Clone

This project is a simplified YouTube clone created as part of my learning journey in HTML and CSS. The focus of this project was to strengthen my understanding of front-end design principles using only HTML and CSS.

Though I have used JavaScript just for looping through all the videos in my data and Generating HTML using JS...Please note that this project does not include JavaScript functionality entirely and, as such, is not fully interactive. The primary goal was to replicate the visual layout and design elements of YouTube, emphasizing static front-end development.
